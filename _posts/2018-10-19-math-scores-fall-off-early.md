Here's an alarming chart about the education gaps for the first few years of a child's education. I don't have any strong ideas for fixes, and don't even have a strong handle on the underlying problems, but the data is something that should drive discussion.

![Fall off in students meeting math standards by grade](/public/images/meeting-math-standards.png)

The Pre-K data is based on [WaKids](http://www.k12.wa.us/wakids/), while the 3rd and 5th grade data is from [SBA](http://www.k12.wa.us/smarter/). This obviously makes this an apples vs oranges comparison (different style of testing might not be comparable), but I found the gap between race to be meaningful.

African American kids are pacing at 87% of white scores in pre-K, but this falls to 49% by 5th grade. Kids are falling behind quickly in their academic careers. Just over 1 in 4 African American kids will be meeting our standards for math success in the 5th grade. When we talk about getting more diversity into computing and the sciences, this becomes a problem. We're failing at the basics before a child is even 10 years old.

*The source code and Jupyter Notebooks are available on [my github](https://github.com/sachbhat/school-analysis), the data pulled was from [OSPI](http://www.k12.wa.us/DataAdmin/default.aspx). I'm still just now really learning Python, Pandas, etc.; if you have tips to make my analysis / code better, please email me. I ðŸ’˜ feedback.*
